1.
SQL IN Operator:
The SQL IN operator is used to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause. It allows you to check if a value exists within a set of values.
The IN operator is an efficient alternative to using multiple OR conditions and is frequently used to filter results based on a specific list of values.
Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);

Example:
SELECT * FROM mysql_learning.product
WHERE brand IN("denim","puma","sony");

Example:
SELECT * FROM mysql_learning.product
WHERE rating IN(3.8,4,2.5);

2.
SQL BETWEEN OPERATOR:
 The SQL BETWEEN operator is used to filter the result set within a specific range. It is often used with WHERE clauses to select values within a range, such as numbers, dates, or text.
The BETWEEN operator is inclusive, meaning it includes the boundary values.
Syntax:
The basic syntax of the 'BETWEEN' operator is as follows:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

Example:
SELECT * FROM mysql_learning.product
WHERE rating BETWEEN 3 AND 4;

Example:
SELECT * FROM mysql_learning.product
WHERE price BETWEEN 200 AND 1000;

3.
ORDERED BY OPERATOR:
The SQL ORDER BY:
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

Example:
SELECT * FROM mysql_learning.product
ORDER BY rating;

Example:
default order is ascending.
SELECT * FROM mysql_learning.product
ORDER BY price;
* ASC , DSC:
SELECT * FROM mysql_learning.product
ORDER BY price , rating DESC;
